Philosophers, C++ STM version
=============================

This is a showcase project of functional design and functional programming in C++.

Philosophers task is solved using custom combinatorial monadic STM library.

Installation
------------

Run in the project dir:

```bash
git clone --branch v0.4 git@github.com:graninas/cpp_stm_free.git ./lib/cpp_stm
```

Then build with Qt.

Requirements
------------

- GCC 7.2

See also: Monadic C++ STM
-------------------------

Working library for Software Transactional Memory that is built using several FP techniques.

- STM is monadic and combinatorial
- It is very robust due to purely functional design
- It is built on top of the custom Free monad
- It operates by custom ADTs
- It is usable despite it's experimental.
